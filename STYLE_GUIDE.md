# Style Guide

- **2-space** indentation.
- **Use double-quotes** (`"`) instead of single-quotes (`'`).
- **No strict rule about indentation**: the best indentation is the one that
  makes your *code more readable*, but the general guideline is to align with
  the previous line.
- **(Right-)Align operators** and assignments *within the same block*.
- Prefer **compact declaration** of modules and classes instead of the
  **indented** style.
