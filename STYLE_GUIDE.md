# Style Guide

## Source code

* **2-space** indentation.
* **Use double-quotes** (`"`) instead of single-quotes (`'`).
* **No strict rule about indentation**: the best indentation is the one that
  makes your *code more readable*, but the general guideline is to align with
  the previous line.
* **(Right-)Align operators** and assignments *within the same block*.
* Use **compact declaration** of modules and classes (*mandatory*).
  *Don't pre-declare inner modules because they will automatically generated by
  the build system.*
* Run `bundle exec rake lint` to perform some automatic checks.

* **Never re-implement the wheel**, always check if missing functionality
  (even dumb print utility) has already been implemented.
* Life is short and it shouldn't be wasted: always think if a functionality or
  method you're using can be **extracted away and made reusable**
  (even dumb functionalities).

## Specs

* Follow the [betterspecs guidelines][betterspecs] (*very important!*).
* Use as **few** parenthesis as possible.
* The tests results must be **human readable**.
* Run `bundle exec rake lint` to perform some automatic checks.
